# FP3: Final Project Assignment 3: Exploration 2
Due Sunday, March 26, 2017

This assignment is the same as [FP1], except definitely choose a library that you expect to use for your full project.

You will be in your team before you complete this assignment. You and your teammate(s) must coordinate to (1) both choose libraries relevant to your project, and (2) each choose a different library.

The report template is below, beginning with "Library Name Here."

## How to Prepare and Submit This Assignment

1. To start, [**fork** this repository][forking]. 
1. Add your `.rkt` Racket source file(s) to the repository. 
1. Add any images to the repository.
1. Modify the `README.md` file and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your report.
1. Ensure your changes (report in `md` file, added `rkt` file(s), and images) are committed to your forked repository.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment.

math/statistics and math/distributions
My name: James Goguen

I spent a lot of time trying to find libraries relevant to our project idea and ultiamtely figured I would
like to have a reliable set of mathematical functions relating to averages and statistics on large sets of information
to be stored in a database.

After going through a lot of the math library, I came across the statistics and distributions part.
Alot of the functions seemed simple, but after palying around with them I realized there was a lot
hidden from the user. 

Discovering the power that a few clean and friendly functions/objects from this library can provide, I chose this lib.



The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. 

You need at least one image (output, diagrams). Images must be uploaded to your repository, and then displayed with markdown in this file; like this:

![test image](/testimage.png?raw=true "test image")

You must provide credit to the source for any borrowed images.

Code should be delivered in two ways:

1. Full files should be added to your version of this repository.
1. Key excerpts of your code should be copied into this .md file, formatted to look like code, and explained.
